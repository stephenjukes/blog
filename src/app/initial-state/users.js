            about: "Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. Originally, my professional interests were focused on paranormal phenomena like ESP, but did not  believe in ghosts until I actually saw one. From time to time I created inventions that helped the saved the day. I was once able to persuade the city mayor to release my team and me after being arrested, return our equipment and support our attempt to stop Gozer.",

I was jointly responsible for pioneering the Ghostbusters' theories and designing and building the equipment used for catching and containing ghosts.",
